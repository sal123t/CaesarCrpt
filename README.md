# CaesarCrpt
Its simple console application for encryption and decryption some eng texts
# Important
1. This one can be successfully decrypted only for large texts from several k symbols, cuz the program algorithm is not just brute force, but a frequency cryptanalysis method.
2. U can use any key to encryption from 0 up to 26
3. The program encrypts only letters from the Latin alphabet. (Not even punctuation)
